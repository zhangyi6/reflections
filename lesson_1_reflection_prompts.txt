How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u oldversion new_version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can view all the old version so that you can easily recover or compare the difference between two of them 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    when you make a logistic change, you should create commit manually;

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because you told me

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you should type the "git log + 'url'" to download the commit from asteroids,
    and "cd asteroids",
    then use your bash to type "git log",then you go into the log history

    when you want to check the difference between two version,you can use "git diff" to view them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    yes, I think so,because when you make some terrible damages, you can run the code "git checkout + ID",then you will recove the old version to figure out what made your programme fail

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    I want to use git to increase my work efficiency
